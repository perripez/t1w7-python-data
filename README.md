# Advanced Data Types

## Lists (familiar face)
- Ordered, mutable (changable: can add, replace or remove) collections of items. 
- Defined ny enclosing elements in square brackets.
- Eg. fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"].

## Tuples
[tuples code](tuples.py)
- Ordered, howver they are immutable (unchangable, cannot add or replace).collections of items.
- Defined by enclosing elements in paranthesis/small brackets ().

## Sets
[sets code](sets.py)
- Unordered collection of unique elements (cannot have identical elements)
- Useful for membership testing (check if numbers are not duplicated) removing duplicates from a sequence and mathematical operations like union, intersection and difference.
- Cannot access elements using index operator []. Need to check if the elements exist in the set or not.
- Defined by enclosing elements in curly brackets {}.
